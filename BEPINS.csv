6,Aquarius,Ketu,Virgo Ascendant,Ketu in Aquarius in 6,"	KETU in this position will bring cataclysmic changes to the person's life, resulting from the distrust, humiliation, and animosity generated by his colleagues and associates. After attaining great proficiency in his trade, he will be forced to alter his life pattern; after having confronted opposi­tion from several quarters, he will gain equanimity and spend his time more or less like a recluse.

6,Piscis,Jupiter,Libra Ascendant,Jupiter in Piscis in 6,"	JUPITER in its own sign makes the individual suffer so rh.at he may learn the lesson of renunciation. Often the various hardships, unconven­tional relationships, and various other experiences the individual has to undergo make him deeply spiritual. He will achieve much renown and will suffer physical or psychological injuries; he will always look to the Supreme, whatever it may mean to him, for the cause and the remedy. Jupiter's influence will permit past karma to surface and confront the individual, who will have to deal with it. But Jupiter will always extend its protective force, enabling him to fulfill his divine mission.",Owns Houses 3 and 6,Piscis in 6,Jupiter in 6,Jupiter in Piscis,Libra Ascendant,753,,,,,,,,,,,,
